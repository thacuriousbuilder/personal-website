Building side projects has always been a source of joy and learning for me. In this post, I want to share why I believe everyone should try building something on their own.

## The Freedom to Experiment
When you work on your own project, you have the freedom to try new technologies, approaches, and ideas without the constraints of a formal job or client work.

### Learning by Doing
Nothing beats hands-on experience. Every side project is an opportunity to learn, fail, and grow.

## Building a Portfolio
Side projects are a great way to showcase your skills to potential employers or collaborators. They are living proof of your initiative and creativity.

# Conclusion
If you've been thinking about starting a side project, go for it! The journey is as rewarding as the outcome.`,

// ### Transparency

// ## Responsibility
// Who is responsible when an AI system causes harm? This is a question that society must grapple with as AI becomes more prevalent.

// Sometimes, writing by hand helps me process information more deeply.

// ## Reviewing and Revisiting
// I regularly review my notes and summarize key insights. This helps reinforce learning and sparks new ideas.

// Organizing reading notes is a personal processâ€”find what works for you and stick with it!`,
